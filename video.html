        <p>Studies show music and music education can have a profound impact on mental and
           physical health for students of all ages, from helping kids learn to read to preventing
           hearing loss in adults, and much more.When you listen to music, multiple areas of your brain become engaged and active. But when you actually
          play an instrument, that activity becomes more like a full-body brain workout!</p>

        <p>Music keeps your ears young. Older musicians don’t experience typical aging in the part of the
         brain (the auditory cortex) that often leads to hearing troubles.
         Music has been found to stimulate parts of the brain, and studies have demonstrated that music
          enhances the memory of Alzheimer's and dementia patients, including a study conducted at UC Irvine,
          which showed that scores on memory tests of Alzheimer's patients improved when they listened to
          classical music.</p>

        <p>Stanford University School of Medicine conducted a study with 30 depressed people over 80 years
           of age and found that participants in a weekly music therapy group were less anxious, less
           distressed and had higher self-esteem.</p>

        <h2>How Children Benefits From Playing Music</h2>

        <p>Music is really beneficial and important for children. Playing a musical instrument strengthens
          eye-hand coordination and fine motor skills, and kids who study an instrument learn a lot about
          discipline, dedication and the rewards of hard work. A study at the University of California at
            Irvine demonstrated that young kids who participated
           in music instruction showed dramatic enhancements in abstract reasoning skills. In fact,
           researchers have found neural firing patterns that suggest that music may hold the key to higher
            brain function.</p>

        <p>Aother research conducted by McGill University in Montreal, Canada showed that grade-school kids who took music
            lessons scored higher on tests of general and spatial cognitive development, the abilities that
            form the basis for performance in math and engineering.</p>
